This is the ==prototype== of a Use Case Catalogue in Obsidian vault. 

A proof of value to demonstrate how easy it is to create a use case documentation just with open source:
- MITRE ATT&CK: [http://attack.mitre.org/resources/working-with-attack/](http://attack.mitre.org/resources/working-with-attack/)
- SIGMA: [https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)
- Atomic Red Team: ([https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)
