## Potential OGNL Injection Exploitation In JVM Based Application

### Description

Detects potential OGNL Injection exploitation, which may lead to RCE.
OGNL is an expression language that is supported in many JVM based systems.
OGNL Injection is the reason for some high profile RCE's such as Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638) and Confluence (CVE-2022-26134)
