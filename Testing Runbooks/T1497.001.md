# T1497.001 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: System Checks

## Atomic Test #1 - Detect Virtualization Environment (Linux)
systemd-detect-virt detects execution in a virtualized environment.
At boot, dmesg stores a log if a hypervisor is detected.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** dfbd1a21-540d-4574-9731-e852bd6fe840






#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```sh
if (systemd-detect-virt) then echo "Virtualization Environment detected"; fi;
if (sudo dmidecode | egrep -i 'manufacturer|product|vendor' | grep -iE 'Oracle|VirtualBox|VMWare|Parallels') then echo "Virtualization Environment detected"; fi;
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Detect Virtualization Environment (FreeBSD)
Detects execution in a virtualized environment.
At boot, dmesg stores a log if a hypervisor is detected.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** e129d73b-3e03-4ae9-bf1e-67fc8921e0fd






#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```sh
if [ "$(sysctl -n hw.hv_vendor)" != "" ]; then echo "Virtualization Environment detected"; fi
```

## Atomic Test #3 - Detect Virtualization Environment (Windows)
Windows Management Instrumentation(WMI) objects contains system information which helps to detect virtualization. This command will specifically attempt to get the CurrentTemperature value from this object and will check to see if the attempt results in an error that contains the word supported. This is meant to find the result of Not supported, which is the result if run in a virtual machine

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 502a7dc4-9d6f-4d28-abf2-f0e84692562d






#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
$error.clear()
Get-WmiObject -Query "SELECT * FROM MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if($error) {echo "Virtualization Environment detected"}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
$error.clear()
```

## Atomic Test #4 - Detect Virtualization Environment (MacOS)
ioreg contains registry entries for all the device drivers in the system. If it's a virtual machine, one of the device manufacturer will be a Virtualization Software.

**Supported Platforms:** macOS


**auto_generated_guid:** a960185f-aef6-4547-8350-d1ce16680d09






#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
if (ioreg -l | grep -e Manufacturer -e 'Vendor Name' | grep -iE 'Oracle|VirtualBox|VMWare|Parallels') then echo 'Virtualization Environment detected'; fi;
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #5 - Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer/Model Listing (Windows)
Windows Management Instrumentation(WMI) objects contain system information which helps to detect virtualization. This test will get the model and manufacturer of the machine to determine if it is a virtual machine, such as through VMware or VirtualBox.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 4a41089a-48e0-47aa-82cb-5b81a463bc78






#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
$Manufacturer = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem | select-object -expandproperty "Manufacturer"
$Model = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem | select-object -expandproperty "Model"
if((($Manufacturer.ToLower() -eq "microsoft corporation") -and ($Model.ToLower().contains("virtual"))) -or ($Manufacturer.ToLower().contains("vmware")) -or ($Model.ToLower() -eq "virtualbox")) {write-host "Virtualization environment detected!"} else {write-host "No virtualization environment detected!"}
```
