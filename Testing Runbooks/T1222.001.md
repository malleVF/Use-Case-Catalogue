## Atomic Test #5 - Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style
Invokes the command line similar to that used by Ryuk Ransomware to grant full access to the entire C:\ drive for Everyone.
**icacls "C:\*" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q**
However, for this atomic we set the permission on C:\Users\Public so it completes faster and doesn't irreversibly affect the host.
You can set your own path variable to "C:\*" if you prefer.
