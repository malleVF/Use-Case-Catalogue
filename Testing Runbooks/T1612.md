# T1612 - Build Image on Host

## Atomic Test #1 - Build Image On Host
Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry. An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then may utilize Deploy Container using that custom image.

**Supported Platforms:** Containers
