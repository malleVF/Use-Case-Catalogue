# T1027.002 - Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing

## Atomic Test #1 - Binary simply packed by UPX (linux)
Copies and then runs a simple binary (just outputting "the cake is a lie"), that was packed by UPX.
No other protection/compression were applied.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** 11c46cd8-e471-450e-acb8-52a1216ae6a4





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| bin_path | Packed binary | path | PathToAtomicsFolder/T1027.002/bin/linux/test_upx|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
cp #{bin_path} /tmp/packed_bin && /tmp/packed_bin
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
rm /tmp/packed_bin
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Binary packed by UPX, with modified headers (linux)
Copies and then runs a simple binary (just outputting "the cake is a lie"), that was packed by UPX.

The UPX magic number (`0x55505821`, "`UPX!`") was changed to (`0x4c4f5452`, "`LOTR`"). This prevents the binary from being detected
by some methods, and especially UPX is not able to uncompress it any more.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux

| bin_path | Packed binary | path | PathToAtomicsFolder/T1027.002/bin/linux/test_upx_header_changed|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
