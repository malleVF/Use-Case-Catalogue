## Atomic Test #7 - Create/Append to .bash_logout
The Bash shell runs ~/.bash_logout "if it exists" to run commands on user logout. An adversary may create or append to a .bash_logout to clear history, start processes etc. Note the ~/.bash_logout is only run if you explicitly exit or log out of an "interactive login shell session" i.e. via the console, SSH, /bin/bash -l or su -l <username>. 

This test creates the art user, logs in, creates a .bash_logout which will echo some text into the art.txt file on logout and logs out and the /home/art/art.txt is created.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** 37ad2f24-7c53-4a50-92da-427a4ad13f58






#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```bash
useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash art
su --login art
echo 'echo "Atomic Red Team was here... T1546.004" >> $HOME/art.txt' >> $HOME/.bash_logout
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```bash
userdel -fr art
```
