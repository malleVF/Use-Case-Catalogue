# T1055.004 - Process Injection: Asynchronous Procedure Call

## Atomic Test #1 - Process Injection via C#
Process Injection using C#
reference: https://github.com/pwndizzle/c-sharp-memory-injection
Excercises Five Techniques
1. Process injection
2. ApcInjectionAnyProcess
3. ApcInjectionNewProcess
4. IatInjection
5. ThreadHijack
Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will execute T1055.exe, which exercises 5 techniques. Output will be via stdout.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| exe_binary | Output Binary | path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1055.004&#92;bin&#92;T1055.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
"#{exe_binary}"
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: #{exe_binary} must be exist on system.
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path "#{exe_binary}") {exit 0} else {exit 1}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path "#{exe_binary}") -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1055.004/bin/T1055.exe" -OutFile "#{exe_binary}"
```

## Atomic Test #2 - EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go
Creates a process in a suspended state and calls QueueUserAPC WinAPI to add a UserAPC to the child process that points to allocated shellcode. 
ResumeThread is called which then calls NtTestAlert to execute the created UserAPC which then executes the shellcode.
This technique allows for the early execution of shellcode and potentially before AV/EDR can hook functions to support detection.

#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| spawn_process_path | Path of the binary to spawn | string | C:&#92;Windows&#92;System32&#92;werfault.exe|
| spawn_process_name | Name of the process to spawn | string | werfault|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
$PathToAtomicsFolder\T1055.004\bin\x64\EarlyBird.exe -program "#{spawn_process_path}" -debug
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Stop-Process -Name CalculatorApp -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "#{spawn_process_name}" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Atomic Test #3 - Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI
Uses the undocumented NtQueueAPCThreadEx WinAPI to create a "Special User APC" in the current thread of the current process to execute shellcode. 
Since the shellcode is loaded and executed in the current process it is considered local shellcode execution.

Steps taken with this technique
1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions to Read/Write
2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space
3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect
4. Get a handle to the current thread
5. Execute the shellcode in the current thread by creating a Special User APC through the NtQueueApcThreadEx function
