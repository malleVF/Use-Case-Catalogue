# T1654 - Log Enumeration

## Atomic Test #1 - Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log
Uses the built-in PowerShell commandlet Get-EventLog to search for 'SYSTEM' keyword and saves results to a text file.

This technique was observed in a [TheDFIRReport case](https://thedfirreport.com/2023/04/03/malicious-iso-file-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/) 
where the threat actor enumerated the Windows Security audit log to determine user accounts and associated IPv4 addresses.

Successful execution will save matching log events to the users temp folder.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

```powershell
powershell -c "get-eventlog 'Security' | where {$_.Message -like '*SYSTEM*'} | export-csv $env:temp\T1654_events.txt"
```
